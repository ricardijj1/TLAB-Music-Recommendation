    "### Which insights did you gain from your EDA? Were any columns highly correlated? If so, name them.\n",
    "\n",
    "EDA Insists\n",
    "\n",
    "- Most of the features like violence, sadness, and obscene are heavily right-skewed, meaning the majority of songs have low values for these traits.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There’s a clear imbalance in genres and topics pop and country appear the most, and topics like sadness and violence are more frequent.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The correlation heatmap shows that features don’t really overlap much, which is good because it means each one is adding something unique to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The 3D scatter of violence, communication, and sadness shows a lot of overlap across genres, so these features alone don’t clearly separate songs into groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When it comes to preparing the data for KMeans, the skewness and outliers mean I definitely need to scale everything to give features equal weight. And while PCA won’t help the model directly, it’s still useful for visualizing how the clusters look after training.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How did you determine which columns to drop or keep? If your EDA informed this process, explain which insights you used to determine which columns were not needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "I knew to removed all non-numerical columns such as artist_name, track_name, release_date, lyrics, genre, and topic. These columns were not directly usable in KMeans clustering, which requires numerical input.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What was the optimal number of clusters in your cluster model? Explain how you determined this value.\n",
    "\n",
    "I used both the elbow method and silhouette scores to decide on the best value for K. Based on the highest silhouette score and a clear bend in the elbow plot, I chose K = 10 for my final model. This number gave me well-separated and stable clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Take a look at the respective songs that fell into your clusters. Describe these clusters in human terms to the best of your ability using the columns in your dataset (for example high-gospel songs, low-gospel songs, etc). Feel free to listen to these songs as well to get a sense of what nuance your algorithm picked up on. \n",
    "\n",
    "I was able to determine the top features in each of my clusters. Using those top features, I gave each cluster a descriptive name. For example, Cluster 0 was labeled world/life_violence_obscene_sadness, which led me to believe that the songs in this group are emotionally heavy tracks that deal with real-world struggles, explicit content, and themes of sadness or pain.\n",

    "Cluster 2 – movement/places_communication_romantic_sadness\n",
    "This cluster likely contains relationship-driven songs focused on emotional journeys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cluster 3 – night/time_violence_world/life_sadness\n",
    "These songs seem to capture gritty songs set in night-time with a darker moods, and some violence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cluster 4 – music_violence_age_world/life\n",
    "Songs here may possibly be older with a  more reflective perspectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cluster 5 – romantic_age_len_violence\n",
    "This group may represent intense romantic songs, with a focus on mature emotions and conflict.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cluster 6 – violence_sadness_obscene_world/life\n",
    "Songs in this cluster are likely raw and explicit, exploring themes of hardship, pain, and life in a tough environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cluster 7 – dating_violence_movement/places_feelings\n",
    "These tracks may reflect on modern dating chaos, with emotional ups and downs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cluster 8 – shake the audience_light/visual perceptions_communication_sadness\n",
    "This group appears to be expressive, emotionally rich songs  with vivid imagery and heartfelt storytelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cluster 9 – sadness_violence_obscene_world/life\n",

    "### Take a look at the clusters that your algorithm assigned to your test samples. Based on these clusters, which songs would you recommend to this user?\n",
    "Most of the new songs fell into Cluster 6, which I labeled as “violence_sadness_obscene_world/life”. This suggests the user is drawn to songs that carry darker themes. I would recommend these songs: \t\n",
